# final_project_1300
This is the repository for the milestone2 files that will eventually incorporate into the Final Project files.

The banner and nav bar are a separate php file that is included in the main index.php file. For now, the banner image and styling has yet to be finally determined. There is a new picture (the one with the numbers) that is slightly lighter and might be a good option. We will have to come up with a color scheme for the page.

The main body div, which we could call "main" ?, with all the information like the media files (Xi mentioned a movie), still has to be made. I was thinking that it would be good to make this into another div (maybe called main.php) that we can then include.

If everybody wants to take their own part of the site and build it as a php so that we can include it to the index, that would be great. Mention your strengths in the GroupMe so that you can spend the most time on things you are good at, like styling in CSS if you like that.

Let's make this a great site!
